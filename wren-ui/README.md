This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Step 1. Make sure your node version is 16
```bash
node -v
```

Step 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn 
```

Step 3. Run migrations(sqlite):

```bash
yarn migrate
# or
npm run migrate
```

To use Postgres as the database of wren-ui, you need to set the two environment variable below.
PG_URL is the connection string of your postgres database.
```bash
# windows
SET DB_TYPE=pg
SET PG_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname 

# linux or mac
export DB_TYPE=pg
export PG_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

Step 4. Run the development server:

```bash
# Execute this if you start wren-engine and ibis-server via docker
# Linux or MacOS
export OTHER_SERVICE_USING_DOCKER=true
# Windows
SET OTHER_SERVICE_USING_DOCKER=true


# Run the development server
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
