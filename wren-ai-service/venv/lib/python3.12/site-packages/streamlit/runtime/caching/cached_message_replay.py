"""
Note [DeltaGenerator method invocation]
There are two top level DG instances defined for all apps:
`main`, which is for putting elements in the main part of the app
`sidebar`, for the sidebar

There are 3 different ways an st function can be invoked:
1. Implicitly on the main DG instance (plain `st.foo` calls)
2. Implicitly in an active contextmanager block (`st.foo` within a `with st.container` context)
3. Explicitly on a DG instance (`st.sidebar.foo`, `my_column_1.foo`)

To simplify replaying messages from a cached function result, we convert all of these
to explicit invocations. How they get rewritten depends on if the invocation was
implicit vs explicit, and if the target DG has been seen/produced during replay.

Implicit invocation on a known DG -> Explicit invocation on that DG
Implicit invocation on an unknown DG -> Rewrite as explicit invocation on main
    with st.container():
        my_cache_decorated_function()

    This is situation 2 above, and the DG is a block entirely outside our function call,
    so we interpret it as "put this element in the enclosing contextmanager block"
    (or main if there isn't one), which is achieved by invoking on main.
Explicit invocation on a known DG -> No change needed
Explicit invocation on an unknown DG -> Raise an error
    We have no way to identify the target DG, and it may not even be present in the
    current script run, so the least surprising thing to do is raise an error.
