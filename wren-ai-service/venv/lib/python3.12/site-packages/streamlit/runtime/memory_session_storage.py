        ----------
        maxsize
            The maximum number of sessions we allow to be stored in this
            MemorySessionStorage. If an entry needs to be removed because we have
            exceeded this number, either
            - an expired entry is removed, or
            - the least recently used entry is removed (if no entries have expired).

        ttl_seconds
            The time in seconds for an entry added to a MemorySessionStorage to live.
            After this amount of time has passed for a given entry, it becomes
            inaccessible and will be removed eventually.
