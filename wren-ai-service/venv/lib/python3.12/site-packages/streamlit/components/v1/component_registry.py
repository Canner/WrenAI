    The component is not registered when there is no ``ScriptRunContext``.
    This can happen when a ``CustomComponent`` is executed as standalone
    command (e.g. for testing).

    To use this function, import it from the ``streamlit.components.v1``
    module.

    .. warning::
        Using ``st.components.v1.declare_component`` directly (instead of
        importing its module) is deprecated and will be disallowed in a later
        version.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        A short, descriptive name for the component, like "slider".

    path: str, Path, or None
        The path to serve the component's frontend files from. The path should
        be absolute. If ``path`` is ``None`` (default), Streamlit will serve
        the component from the location in ``url``. Either ``path`` or ``url``
        must be specified, but not both.

    url: str or None
        The URL that the component is served from. If ``url`` is ``None``
        (default), Streamlit will serve the component from the location in
        ``path``. Either ``path`` or ``url`` must be specified, but not both.

    Returns
    -------
    CustomComponent
        A ``CustomComponent`` that can be called like a function.
        Calling the component will create a new instance of the component
        in the Streamlit app.
