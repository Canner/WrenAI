# The components.py file exists because existing custom components have started
# to rely on internals of the components package. For example, streamlit-option-menu accesses
# [register_widget](https://github.com/victoryhb/streamlit-option-menu/blob/master/streamlit_option_menu/streamlit_callback.py#L28),
# which is only a transitive import through `streamlit.components.v1.custom_component`.
# Since we do not know what other internals are used out in the wild, let's try to
# model the old behavior and not to break things.

# This should be cleaned up in the future, e.g. as part of components v2.
