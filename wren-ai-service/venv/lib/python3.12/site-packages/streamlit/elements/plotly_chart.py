    The schema for the Plotly chart selection state.

    The selection state is stored in a dictionary-like object that supports both
    key and attribute notation. Selection states cannot be programmatically
    changed or set through Session State.

    Attributes
    ----------
    points : list[dict[str, Any]]
        The selected data points in the chart, including the data points
        selected by the box and lasso mode. The data includes the values
        associated to each point and a point index used to populate
        ``point_indices``. If additional information has been assigned to your
        points, such as size or legend group, this is also included.

    point_indices : list[int]
        The numerical indices of all selected data points in the chart. The
        details of each identified point are included in ``points``.

    box : list[dict[str, Any]]
        The metadata related to the box selection. This includes the
        coordinates of the selected area.

    lasso : list[dict[str, Any]]
        The metadata related to the lasso selection. This includes the
        coordinates of the selected area.

    Example
    -------
    When working with more complicated graphs, the ``points`` attribute
    displays additional information. Try selecting points in the following
    example:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> import plotly.express as px
    >>>
    >>> df = px.data.iris()
    >>> fig = px.scatter(
    ...     df,
    ...     x="sepal_width",
    ...     y="sepal_length",
    ...     color="species",
    ...     size="petal_length",
    ...     hover_data=["petal_width"],
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> event = st.plotly_chart(fig, key="iris", on_select="rerun")
    >>>
    >>> event.selection

    .. output::
        https://doc-chart-events-plotly-selection-state.streamlit.app
        height: 600px

    This is an example of the selection state when selecting a single point:

    >>> {
    >>>   "points": [
    >>>     {
    >>>       "curve_number": 2,
    >>>       "point_number": 9,

    Attributes

    Example

        """Display an interactive Plotly chart.

        `Plotly <https://plot.ly/python>`_ is a charting library for Python.
        The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly's
        ``plot()`` function.

        To show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call ``st.plotly_chart`` wherever
        you would call Plotly's ``py.plot`` or ``py.iplot``.

        .. Important::
            You must install ``plotly`` to use this command. Your app's
            performance may be enhanced by installing ``orjson`` as well.

        Parameters
        ----------
        figure_or_data : plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,\
            or dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data

            The Plotly ``Figure`` or ``Data`` object to render. See
            https://plot.ly/python/ for examples of graph descriptions.

        use_container_width : bool
            Whether to override the figure's native width with the width of
            the parent container. If ``use_container_width`` is ``False``
            (default), Streamlit sets the width of the chart to fit its contents
            according to the plotting library, up to the width of the parent
            container. If ``use_container_width`` is ``True``, Streamlit sets
            the width of the figure to match the width of the parent container.

        theme : "streamlit" or None
            The theme of the chart. If ``theme`` is ``"streamlit"`` (default),
            Streamlit uses its own design default. If ``theme`` is ``None``,
            Streamlit falls back to the default behavior of the library.

        key : str
            An optional string to use for giving this element a stable
            identity. If ``key`` is ``None`` (default), this element's identity
            will be determined based on the values of the other parameters.

            Additionally, if selections are activated and ``key`` is provided,
            Streamlit will register the key in Session State to store the
            selection state. The selection state is read-only.

        on_select : "ignore" or "rerun" or callable
            How the figure should respond to user selection events. This
            controls whether or not the figure behaves like an input widget.
            ``on_select`` can be one of the following:

            - ``"ignore"`` (default): Streamlit will not react to any selection
              events in the chart. The figure will not behave like an input
              widget.

            - ``"rerun"``: Streamlit will rerun the app when the user selects
              data in the chart. In this case, ``st.plotly_chart`` will return
              the selection data as a dictionary.

            - A ``callable``: Streamlit will rerun the app and execute the
              ``callable`` as a callback function before the rest of the app.
              In this case, ``st.plotly_chart`` will return the selection data
              as a dictionary.

        selection_mode : "points", "box", "lasso" or an Iterable of these
            The selection mode of the chart. This can be one of the following:

            - ``"points"``: The chart will allow selections based on individual
              data points.
            - ``"box"``: The chart will allow selections based on rectangular
              areas.
            - ``"lasso"``: The chart will allow selections based on freeform
              areas.
            - An ``Iterable`` of the above options: The chart will allow
              selections based on the modes specified.

            All selections modes are activated by default.

        **kwargs
            Any argument accepted by Plotly's ``plot()`` function.

        Returns
        -------
        element or dict
            If ``on_select`` is ``"ignore"`` (default), this command returns an
            internal placeholder for the chart element. Otherwise, this command
            returns a dictionary-like object that supports both key and
            attribute notation. The attributes are described by the
            ``PlotlyState`` dictionary schema.

        Example
        -------
        The example below comes straight from the examples at
        https://plot.ly/python. Note that ``plotly.figure_factory`` requires
        ``scipy`` to run.

        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import plotly.figure_factory as ff
        >>>
        >>> # Add histogram data
        >>> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2
        >>> x2 = np.random.randn(200)
        >>> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2
        >>>
        >>> # Group data together
        >>> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]
        >>>
        >>> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']
        >>>
        >>> # Create distplot with custom bin_size
        >>> fig = ff.create_distplot(
