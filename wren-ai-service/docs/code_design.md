## Purpose

This document aims to dive deep to the implementation details of the codebase of wren-ai-service. We have two goals in mind while writing the document:
1. You will be more knowledgeable about how wren-ai-service works under the hood.
2. You will be more confident on what part of codebase is needed for adjustment if you would like to be Wren AI's contributor.
