# MUST READ!!!

Since these config files are examples, so **please carefully read the file and comments inside**. Try to understand the purpose of each section and parameter, **don't simply copy and paste the content of these config files into your own config file. It will not work.** We also definitely welcome your contribution to add config files for other LLM providers.
