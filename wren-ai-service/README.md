# AI Service of Wren AI

## Concepts

Please read the [documentation](https://docs.getwren.ai/concept/wren_ai_service) here to understand the concepts of Wren AI Service.

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12.0, recommended to use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to manage the Python versions
- install `poetry` with version 1.8.3: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --version 1.8.3`
- execute `poetry install` to install the dependencies
- copy `.env.example` file to `.env`, and `.env.dev.example` file to `.env.dev` and fill in the environment variables
- [for development] execute `poetry run pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks and `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files` to run the pre-commit checks at the first time to check if everything is set up correctly
- [for development] to run the tests, execute `make test`

## Start the service for development

The following commands can quickly start the service for development:

- `make dev-up` to start needed containers
- `make start` to start the service 
    - go to `http://WREN_AI_SERVICE_HOST:WREN_AI_SERVICE_PORT`(default is http://localhost:5556) to see the API 
    documentation and try them.
    - go to `http://WREN_UI_HOST:WREN_UI_PORT`(default is http://localhost:3000) to interact interact from the UI
- `make dev-down` to stop the needed containers

## Pipeline Evaluation(Deprecated, will introduce new way to evaluate the speed in the future)

- install `psql`
- fill in environment variables: `.env.dev` in the src folder and `config.properties` in the src/eval/wren-engine/etc folder
- start the docker service
- evaluation
  - `make eval pipeline=ask args="--help"`
  - `make eval pipeline=ask_details args="--help"`
- `make eval_visualzation` to compare between the evaluation results
- to run individual pipeline: `poetry run python -m src.pipelines.ask.[pipeline_name]` (e.g. `poetry run python -m src.pipelines.ask.retrieval_pipeline`)

### Speed Evaluation(Deprecated, will introduce new way to evaluate the speed in the future)

- to evaluate the speed of the pipeline, you can enable the timer
  - add environment variables `ENABLE_TIMER=1` in `.env.dev`
  - restart wren ai service
  - check the logs in the terminal
- to run the load test
  - setup `DATASET_NAME` in `.env.dev`
  - adjust test config if needed
    - adjust test config in pyproject.toml `tool.locust` section
    - adjust user count in `tests/locust/config_users.json`
  - in wren-ai-service folder, run `make dev-up` to start the docker containers
  - in wren-ai-service folder, run `make start` to start the ai service
  - run `make load-test`
  - check reports in /outputs/locust folder, there are 3 files with filename **locust_report_{test_timestamp}**:
    - .json: test report in json format, including info like llm provider, version
    - .html: test report in html format, showing tables and charts
    - .log: test log

## Demo(Deprecated)

- go to the `demo` folder and run `poetry install` to install the dependencies
- in the `wren-ai-service` folder, open three terminals
  - in the first terminal, run `make dev-up` to start the docker container
  - in the second terminal, run `make start` to start the wren-ai service
  - in the third terminal, run `make demo` to start the demo service
- ports of the services:
  - wren-engine: ports should be 8080
  - wren-ai-service: port should be 5556
  - wren-ui: port should be 3000
  - qdrant: ports should be 6333, 6334
