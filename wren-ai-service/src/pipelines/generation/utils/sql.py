_DEFAULT_TEXT_TO_SQL_RULES = """
### SQL RULES ###
- ONLY USE SELECT statements, NO DELETE, UPDATE OR INSERT etc. statements that might change the data in the database.
- ONLY USE the tables and columns mentioned in the database schema.
- ONLY USE "*" if the user query asks for all the columns of a table.
- ONLY CHOOSE columns belong to the tables mentioned in the database schema.
- DON'T INCLUDE comments in the generated SQL query.
- YOU MUST USE "JOIN" if you choose columns from multiple tables!
- PREFER USING CTEs over subqueries.
- When generating SQL query, always:
    - Put double quotes around column and table names.
    - Put single quotes around string literals.
    - Never quote numeric literals.
- YOU MUST USE "lower(<table_name>.<column_name>) like lower(<value>)" function or "lower(<table_name>.<column_name>) = lower(<value>)" function for case-insensitive comparison!
    - Use "lower(<table_name>.<column_name>) LIKE lower(<value>)" when:
        - The user requests a pattern or partial match.
        - The value is not specific enough to be a single, exact value.
        - Wildcards (%) are needed to capture the pattern.
    - Use "lower(<table_name>.<column_name>) = lower(<value>)" when:
        - The user requests an exact, specific value.
        - There is no ambiguity or pattern in the value.
- If the column is date/time related field, and it is a INT/BIGINT/DOUBLE/FLOAT type, please use the appropriate function mentioned in the SQL FUNCTIONS section to cast the column to "TIMESTAMP" type first before using it in the query
- ALWAYS CAST the date/time related field to "TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE" type when using them in the query
- If the user asks for a specific date, please give the date range in SQL query
- USE THE VIEW TO SIMPLIFY THE QUERY.
- DON'T MISUSE THE VIEW NAME. THE ACTUAL NAME IS FOLLOWING THE CREATE VIEW STATEMENT.
- ONLY USE table/column alias in the final SELECT clause; don't use table/columnalias in the other clauses.
- Refer to the value of alias from the comment section of the corresponding table or column in the DATABASE SCHEMA section for reference when using alias in the final SELECT clause.
- DON'T USE '.' in column/table alias, replace '.' with '_' in column/table alias.
- DON'T USE "FILTER(WHERE <expression>)" clause in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE "EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM <expression>)" clause in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE "EXTRACT()" function with INTERVAL data types as arguments
- DON'T USE INTERVAL or generate INTERVAL-like expression in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE "TO_CHAR" function in the generated SQL query.
- Aggregate functions are not allowed in the WHERE clause. Instead, they belong in the HAVING clause, which is used to filter after aggregation.
- You can only add "ORDER BY" and "LIMIT" to the final "UNION" result.
- For the ranking problem, you must use the ranking function, `DENSE_RANK()` to rank the results and then use `WHERE` clause to filter the results.
- For the ranking problem, you must add the ranking column to the final SELECT clause.
"""


_DEFAULT_CALCULATED_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS = """
#### Instructions for Calculated Field ####

The first structure is the special column marked as "Calculated Field". You need to interpret the purpose and calculation basis for these columns, then utilize them in the following text-to-sql generation tasks.
First, provide a brief explanation of what each field represents in the context of the schema, including how each field is computed using the relationships between models.
Then, during the following tasks, if the user queries pertain to any calculated fields defined in the database schema, ensure to utilize those calculated fields appropriately in the output SQL queries.
The goal is to accurately reflect the intent of the question in the SQL syntax, leveraging the pre-computed logic embedded within the calculated fields.
"""

_DEFAULT_METRIC_INSTRUCTIONS = """
#### Instructions for Metric ####

Second, you will learn how to effectively utilize the special "metric" structure in text-to-SQL generation tasks.
Metrics in a data model simplify complex data analysis by structuring data through predefined dimensions and measures.
This structuring closely mirrors the concept of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes but is implemented in a more flexible and SQL-friendly manner.

The metric typically constructed of the following components:
1. Base Object
The "base object" of a metric indicates the primary data source or table that provides the raw data.
Metrics are constructed by selecting specific data points (dimensions and measures) from this base object, effectively creating a summarized or aggregated view of the data that can be queried like a normal table.
Base object is the attribute of the metric, showing the origin of this metric and is typically not used in the query.
2. Dimensions
Dimensions in a metric represent the various axes along which data can be segmented for analysis.
These are fields that provide a categorical breakdown of data.
Each dimension provides a unique perspective on the data, allowing users to "slice and dice" the data cube to view different facets of the information contained within the base dataset.
Dimensions are used as table columns in the querying process. Querying a dimension means to get the statistic from the certain perspective.
3. Measures
Measures are numerical or quantitative statistics calculated from the data. Measures are key results or outputs derived from data aggregation functions like SUM, COUNT, or AVG.
Measures are used as table columns in the querying process, and are the main querying items in the metric structure.
The expression of a measure represents the definition of the  that users are intrested in. Make sure to understand the meaning of measures from their expressions.
4. Time Grain
Time Grain specifies the granularity of time-based data aggregation, such as daily, monthly, or yearly, facilitating trend analysis over specified periods.

If the given schema contains the structures marked as 'metric', you should first interpret the metric schema based on the above definition.
Then, during the following tasks, if the user queries pertain to any metrics defined in the database schema, ensure to utilize those metrics appropriately in the output SQL queries.
The target is making complex data analysis more accessible and manageable by pre-aggregating data and structuring it using the metric structure, and supporting direct querying for business insights.
"""

_DEFAULT_JSON_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS = """
#### Instructions for JSON related functions ####
- ONLY USE JSON_QUERY for querying fields if "json_type":"JSON" is identified in the columns comment, NOT the deprecated JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR function.
    - DON'T USE CAST for JSON fields, ONLY USE the following funtions:
      - LAX_BOOL for boolean fields
      - LAX_FLOAT64 for double and float fields
      - LAX_INT64 for bigint fields
      - LAX_STRING for varchar fields
- ONLY USE JSON_QUERY_ARRAY for querying "json_type":"JSON_ARRAY" is identified in the comment of the column, NOT the deprecated JSON_EXTRACT_ARRAY.
    - USE UNNEST to analysis each item individually in the ARRAY. YOU MUST SELECT FROM the parent table ahead of the UNNEST ARRAY.
    - The alias of the UNNEST(ARRAY) should be in the format `unnest_table_alias(individual_item_alias)`
    - If the items in the ARRAY are JSON objects, use JSON_QUERY to query the fields inside each JSON item.
    - To JOIN ON the fields inside UNNEST(ARRAY), YOU MUST SELECT FROM the parent table ahead of the UNNEST syntax, and the alias of the UNNEST(ARRAY) SHOULD BE IN THE FORMAT unnest_table_alias(individual_item_alias)
- DON'T USE JSON_QUERY and JSON_QUERY_ARRAY when "json_type":"".
- DON'T USE LAX_BOOL, LAX_FLOAT64, LAX_INT64, LAX_STRING when "json_type":"".
"""

sql_samples_instructions = """
#### Instructions for SQL Samples ####

Finally, you will learn from the sample SQL queries provided in the input. These samples demonstrate best practices and common patterns for querying this specific database.

For each sample, you should:
1. Study the question that explains what the query aims to accomplish
2. Analyze the SQL implementation to understand:
   - Table structures and relationships used
   - Specific functions and operators employed
   - Query patterns and techniques demonstrated
3. Use these samples as reference patterns when generating similar queries
4. Adapt the techniques shown in the samples to match new query requirements while maintaining consistent style and approach

The samples will help you understand:
- Preferred table join patterns
- Common aggregation methods
- Specific function usage
- Query structure and formatting conventions

When generating new queries, try to follow similar patterns when applicable, while adapting them to the specific requirements of each new query.

Learn about the usage of the schema structures and generate SQL based on them.
