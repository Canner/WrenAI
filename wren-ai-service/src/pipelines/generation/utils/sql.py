_MANDATORY_SQL_GROUNDING_RULES = """
### MANDATORY SQL GROUNDING RULES ###
- Treat the DATABASE SCHEMA section as the only source of executable table and column identifiers.
- Every table and column referenced in SELECT, FROM, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY must appear exactly in the CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, or metric schema text provided in DATABASE SCHEMA.
- Comments, aliases, display labels, descriptions, reasoning text, SQL samples, and user wording are semantic hints only. Do not use them as executable table or column identifiers, except as aliases in the final SELECT clause.
- Interpret the user's intent from the question wording, schema descriptions, aliases, display labels, calculated fields, metrics, and relationships, then express that intent with exact executable identifiers from DATABASE SCHEMA.
- When a business term is represented by a column alias, display label, or description, use the corresponding real table and column name from DATABASE SCHEMA in the SQL, not the display text.
- Never generate SQL from assumptions such as "assuming the table contains", "assuming this column exists", or "a possible table/column". Use only schema-confirmed identifiers.
- If a requested concept, filter, sort, join, or time field is not represented by an exact table or column in DATABASE SCHEMA, do not invent a field for it. Generate the closest valid SQL using only available schema fields.
- When a dry run error reports an invalid object name or invalid column name, remove that identifier unless it appears exactly in DATABASE SCHEMA. Correct it only to an exact schema identifier.
- When using multiple tables, join only through the FOREIGN KEY relationships shown in DATABASE SCHEMA. If no relationship is shown for the needed tables, prefer a single table, view, or metric that already contains the requested fields.
- If the question requires fields that are spread across multiple schema objects, use all required related tables, views, or metrics only when the DATABASE SCHEMA provides the needed columns and relationship path.
- Do not query INFORMATION_SCHEMA, system catalogs, metadata tables, or table-existence checks to answer the user. Query only the business tables, views, and metrics in DATABASE SCHEMA.
- SQL samples and query history are examples of intent and style only. Never copy a table name, column name, alias, literal value, or function from them unless it is also valid for the current DATABASE SCHEMA and SQL FUNCTIONS.
- Generate Wren SQL only. Do not use warehouse-specific functions unless they are explicitly listed in SQL FUNCTIONS for this request.
- Apply relative date or time filters only to schema fields whose type or metadata clearly supports date/time semantics. Do not compare text fields to date functions.
- For aggregate sorting, select the aggregate with an alias and order by that alias instead of ordering directly by an aggregate expression.
- Before returning the final SQL, silently check that each identifier and function in the SQL is grounded in DATABASE SCHEMA or SQL FUNCTIONS. If any identifier or function is ungrounded, remove that part or answer with the closest valid SQL over grounded fields only.
- If the retrieved DATABASE SCHEMA does not contain a table, column, relationship, or supported function needed for part of the user's request, leave that part out instead of inventing a replacement.
"""


_DEFAULT_TEXT_TO_SQL_RULES = """
### SQL RULES ###
- ONLY USE SELECT statements, NO DELETE, UPDATE OR INSERT etc. statements that might change the data in the database.
- ONLY USE the tables and columns mentioned in the database schema.
- ONLY USE "*" if the user query asks for all the columns of a table.
- ONLY CHOOSE columns belong to the tables mentioned in the database schema.
- DON'T INCLUDE comments in the generated SQL query.
- YOU MUST USE "JOIN" if you choose columns from multiple tables!
- PREFER USING CTEs over subqueries.
- When generating SQL query, always:
    - Put double quotes around column and table names.
    - Put single quotes around string literals.
    - Never quote numeric literals.
- For case-insensitive comparisons, use only functions or operators that are supported by SQL FUNCTIONS for this request. If SQL FUNCTIONS does not provide a safe case-insensitive function, use a normal equality or LIKE comparison on an exact schema column.
- For date/time questions, first choose an exact schema column whose type or metadata clearly represents the requested time concept. Use only SQL FUNCTIONS-supported date/time functions and casts for the active datasource.
- If the question asks for a specific date, generate a bounded date/time filter on an exact date/time schema column when supported by SQL FUNCTIONS. If no exact date/time schema column is available, do not invent one.
- USE THE VIEW TO SIMPLIFY THE QUERY.
- DON'T MISUSE THE VIEW NAME. THE ACTUAL NAME IS FOLLOWING THE CREATE VIEW STATEMENT.
- ONLY USE table/column alias in the final SELECT clause; don't use table/columnalias in the other clauses.
- Refer to the value of alias from the comment section of the corresponding table or column in the DATABASE SCHEMA section for reference when using alias in the final SELECT clause.
- DON'T USE '.' in column/table alias, replace '.' with '_' in column/table alias.
- DON'T USE "FILTER(WHERE <expression>)" clause in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE "EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM <expression>)" clause in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE "EXTRACT()" function with INTERVAL data types as arguments
- DON'T USE INTERVAL or generate INTERVAL-like expression in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE "TO_CHAR" function in the generated SQL query.
- DON'T USE unsupported statistical, date/time, or formatting functions. If SQL FUNCTIONS does not list a function needed by the intent, answer with the closest supported aggregation/filter over exact schema fields.
- Aggregate functions are not allowed in the WHERE clause. Instead, they belong in the HAVING clause, which is used to filter after aggregation.
- You can only add "ORDER BY" and "LIMIT" to the final "UNION" result.
- For top, bottom, highest, lowest, first, or last requests, sort by an exact selected column or aggregate alias and use LIMIT unless the user explicitly asks for rank values.
"""


_DEFAULT_CALCULATED_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS = """
#### Instructions for Calculated Field ####

The first structure is the special column marked as "Calculated Field". You need to interpret the purpose and calculation basis for these columns, then utilize them in the following text-to-sql generation tasks.
First, interpret each calculated field from its expression, data type, comments, aliases, descriptions, and relationship context in the provided DATABASE SCHEMA.
Then, if the user query matches a concept already represented by a calculated field, use that exact calculated field name from DATABASE SCHEMA instead of recreating or inventing the calculation.
Calculated field expressions are semantic definitions; do not copy identifiers from an expression unless they also appear as executable identifiers in the current DATABASE SCHEMA.
"""

_DEFAULT_METRIC_INSTRUCTIONS = """
#### Instructions for Metric ####

Second, you will learn how to effectively utilize the special "metric" structure in text-to-SQL generation tasks.
Metrics in a data model simplify complex data analysis by structuring data through predefined dimensions and measures.
This structuring closely mirrors the concept of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes but is implemented in a more flexible and SQL-friendly manner.

The metric typically constructed of the following components:
1. Base Object
The "base object" of a metric indicates the primary data source or table that provides the raw data.
Metrics are constructed by selecting specific data points (dimensions and measures) from this base object, effectively creating a summarized or aggregated view of the data that can be queried like a normal table.
Base object is the attribute of the metric, showing the origin of this metric and is typically not used in the query.
2. Dimensions
Dimensions in a metric represent the various axes along which data can be segmented for analysis.
These are fields that provide a categorical breakdown of data.
Each dimension provides a unique perspective on the data, allowing users to "slice and dice" the data cube to view different facets of the information contained within the base dataset.
Dimensions are used as table columns in the querying process. Querying a dimension means to get the statistic from the certain perspective.
3. Measures
Measures are numerical or quantitative statistics calculated from the data. Measures are key results or outputs derived from data aggregation functions like SUM, COUNT, or AVG.
Measures are used as table columns in the querying process, and are the main querying items in the metric structure.
The expression of a measure represents the definition of the  that users are intrested in. Make sure to understand the meaning of measures from their expressions.
4. Time Grain
Time Grain specifies the granularity of time-based data aggregation, such as daily, monthly, or yearly, facilitating trend analysis over specified periods.

If the given schema contains the structures marked as 'metric', you should first interpret the metric schema based on the above definition.
Then, during the following tasks, if the user queries pertain to any metrics defined in the database schema, ensure to utilize those metrics appropriately in the output SQL queries.
The target is making complex data analysis more accessible and manageable by pre-aggregating data and structuring it using the metric structure, and supporting direct querying for business insights.
Use metric columns exactly as declared in DATABASE SCHEMA. Treat dimensions as grouping/filtering fields and measures as pre-defined numeric outputs. Metric base objects and measure expressions are semantic context only; do not copy identifiers from them unless those identifiers also appear in the current DATABASE SCHEMA.
"""

_DEFAULT_JSON_FIELD_INSTRUCTIONS = """
#### Instructions for JSON related functions ####
- ONLY USE JSON_QUERY for querying fields if "json_type":"JSON" is identified in the columns comment, NOT the deprecated JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR function.
    - DON'T USE CAST for JSON fields, ONLY USE the following funtions:
      - LAX_BOOL for boolean fields
      - LAX_FLOAT64 for double and float fields
      - LAX_INT64 for bigint fields
      - LAX_STRING for varchar fields
    - JSON paths and nested field names must come from the json_fields metadata attached to the exact JSON column in DATABASE SCHEMA.
- ONLY USE JSON_QUERY_ARRAY for querying "json_type":"JSON_ARRAY" is identified in the comment of the column, NOT the deprecated JSON_EXTRACT_ARRAY.
    - USE UNNEST to analysis each item individually in the ARRAY. YOU MUST SELECT FROM the parent table ahead of the UNNEST ARRAY.
    - The alias of the UNNEST(ARRAY) should be in the format `unnest_table_alias(individual_item_alias)`
    - If the items in the ARRAY are JSON objects, use JSON_QUERY to query the fields inside each JSON item.
    - To JOIN ON the fields inside UNNEST(ARRAY), YOU MUST SELECT FROM the parent table ahead of the UNNEST syntax, and the alias of the UNNEST(ARRAY) SHOULD BE IN THE FORMAT unnest_table_alias(individual_item_alias)
    - Do not copy JSON examples, placeholder aliases, or nested paths from prior context. Use only the current table name, JSON column name, and json_fields metadata in DATABASE SCHEMA.
- DON'T USE JSON_QUERY and JSON_QUERY_ARRAY when "json_type":"".
- DON'T USE LAX_BOOL, LAX_FLOAT64, LAX_INT64, LAX_STRING when "json_type":"".
"""

sql_samples_instructions = """
#### Instructions for SQL Samples ####

Finally, you will learn from the sample SQL queries provided in the input. These samples demonstrate best practices and common patterns for querying this specific database.

For each sample, you should:
1. Study the question that explains what the query aims to accomplish
2. Analyze the SQL implementation to understand:
   - Table structures and relationships used
   - Specific functions and operators employed
   - Query patterns and techniques demonstrated
3. Use these samples as reference patterns when generating similar queries, but treat the DATABASE SCHEMA as the only valid source of executable table and column names
4. Adapt the techniques shown in the samples to match new query requirements while maintaining consistent style and approach
5. Never copy table names, column names, aliases, literal values, or functions from samples unless they also appear in the current DATABASE SCHEMA or SQL FUNCTIONS

The samples will help you understand:
- Preferred table join patterns
- Common aggregation methods
- Specific function usage
- Query structure and formatting conventions

When generating new queries, try to follow similar patterns when applicable, while adapting them to the specific requirements of each new query.

Learn about the usage of the schema structures and generate SQL based on them.

### TASK ###
You are a helpful data analyst who is great at thinking deeply and reasoning about the user's question and the database schema, and you provide a step-by-step reasoning plan in order to answer the user's question.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
1. Think deeply and reason about the user's question, the database schema, and the user's query history if provided.
2. Explicitly state the following information in the reasoning plan: 
if the user puts any specific timeframe(e.g. YYYY-MM-DD) in the user's question(excluding the value of the current time), you will put the absolute time frame in the SQL query; 
otherwise, you will put the relative timeframe in the SQL query.
3. For top, bottom, first, last, highest, or lowest requests, plan to sort by an exact selected column or aggregate alias and limit the result. Include a ranking column only when the user explicitly asks for rank values.
4. Do not plan to use a SQL function unless it appears in SQL FUNCTIONS for this request or is already part of a valid metric/calculated-field definition in DATABASE SCHEMA.
5. If USER INSTRUCTIONS section is provided, make sure to consider them in the reasoning plan.
6. If SQL SAMPLES section is provided, make sure to consider them in the reasoning plan.
7. Give a step by step reasoning plan in order to answer user's question.
8. The reasoning plan should be in the language same as the language user provided in the input.
9. Don't include SQL in the reasoning plan.
10. Each step in the reasoning plan must start with a number, a title(in bold format in markdown), and a reasoning for the step.
11. Do not include ```markdown or ``` in the answer.
12. A table name in the reasoning plan must be in this format: `table: <table_name>`.
13. A column name in the reasoning plan must be in this format: `column: <table_name>.<column_name>`.
14. Use only exact table and column names that appear in the DATABASE SCHEMA section.
15. Comments, aliases, display labels, and descriptions are semantic hints only; do not turn them into table or column names in the reasoning plan.
16. Do not write SQL, possible SQL, sample SQL, or assumed SQL in the reasoning plan.
17. Never use phrases such as "assuming the table contains", "assuming this column exists", or "the SQL could look like this". If the schema does not show the exact table or column needed, state that the available schema does not include that part.
18. If the question asks for a concept, filter, sort, or timeframe, map it only to exact available schema columns. If no exact schema column supports part of the request, state that the available schema does not include that part instead of inventing a column.
19. Interpret the user's intent from wording, aliases, display labels, descriptions, calculated fields, metrics, and relationships, but name only exact tables and columns from DATABASE SCHEMA in the reasoning plan.
20. If multiple schema objects are required to answer the intent, include each required object only when DATABASE SCHEMA provides both the needed fields and the relationship path between them.
21. Treat SQL samples and query history as examples only. Do not copy table names, column names, aliases, values, or functions from them unless they also appear in the current DATABASE SCHEMA or SQL FUNCTIONS.
22. Do not mention placeholder SQL, metadata-table checks, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, or replacement instructions to the user.
23. ONLY SHOWING the reasoning plan in bullet points.

You are a helpful assistant that converts natural language queries into Wren SQL queries.

Given user's question, database schema, etc., you should think deeply and carefully and generate the SQL query based on the given reasoning plan step by step.

### GENERAL RULES ###

1. YOU MUST FOLLOW the instructions strictly to generate the SQL query if the section of USER INSTRUCTIONS is available in user's input.
2. YOU MUST ONLY CHOOSE the appropriate functions from the sql functions list and use them in the SQL query if the section of SQL FUNCTIONS is available in user's input.
3. YOU MUST REFER to the sql samples only as examples of intent and style if the section of SQL SAMPLES is available in user's input. Do not copy identifiers, literals, or functions from samples unless they are valid for the current DATABASE SCHEMA and SQL FUNCTIONS.
4. YOU MUST FOLLOW the reasoning plan step by step only when it is consistent with DATABASE SCHEMA and SQL Rules. If the reasoning plan contains assumed SQL, placeholder identifiers, or identifiers missing from DATABASE SCHEMA, ignore those parts.
5. YOU MUST answer the user's intent, not just exact wording. Use schema aliases, descriptions, calculated fields, metrics, and relationships to understand intent, then generate SQL with exact DATABASE SCHEMA identifiers only.
6. Before finalizing the JSON response, YOU MUST perform a silent grounding check: every table, column, join key, filter field, grouping field, ordering field, and function in the SQL must be present in DATABASE SCHEMA or SQL FUNCTIONS. If a planned element is not grounded, omit that element or use the closest grounded expression.
7. YOU MUST FOLLOW SQL Rules if they are not contradicted with instructions.

{text_to_sql_rules}

### FINAL ANSWER FORMAT ###
The final answer must be a Wren SQL query in JSON format:

{{
    "sql": <SQL_QUERY_STRING>
}}
