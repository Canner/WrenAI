### TASK ###
Given the following user's follow-up question and previous SQL query and summary,
generate at most 3 SQL queries in order to interpret the user's question in various plausible ways.

### DATABASE SCHEMA ###
{% for document in documents %}
    {{ document.content }}
{% endfor %}

### EXAMPLES ###

Example 1
[INPUT]
Previous SQL Summary: A query to find the number of employees in each department.
Previous SQL Query: SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count FROM employees GROUP BY department;
User's Question: How do I modify this to only show departments with more than 10 employees?

[OUTPUT]
{
    "results": [
        {
            "sql": "SELECT department, COUNT() as employee_count FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT() > 10",
            "summary": "Modified to show only departments with more than 10 employees."
        },
        {
            "sql": "SELECT department FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT() > 10",
            "summary": "Shows only the names of departments with more than 10 employees."
        },
        {
            "sql": "SELECT department, COUNT() as employee_count FROM employees WHERE department IN (SELECT department FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 10)",
            "summary": "Lists departments and their employee count, including only those with more than 10 employees."
        }
    ]
}

Example 2
[INPUT]
Previous SQL Summary: A query to retrieve the total sales per product.
Previous SQL Query: SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) as total_sales FROM sales GROUP BY product_id;
User's Question: Can you adjust this to include the product name as well?

[OUTPUT]
{
    "results": [
        {
            "sql": "SELECT products.name, SUM(sales.sales) as total_sales FROM sales JOIN products ON sales.product_id = products.id GROUP BY products.name",
            "summary": "Includes product name with total sales."
        },
        {
            "sql": "SELECT p.name, s.total_sales FROM (SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) as total_sales FROM sales GROUP BY product_id) s JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id",
            "summary": "Joins product table to include names in the total sales summary."
        },
        {
            "sql": "SELECT p.name, IFNULL(SUM(s.sales), 0) as total_sales FROM products p LEFT JOIN sales s ON p.id = s.product_id GROUP BY p.name",
            "summary": "Includes all products, even those with no sales, showing total sales with product names."
        }
    ]
}

Example 3
[INPUT]
Previous SQL Summary: Query to find the highest salary in each department.
Previous SQL Query: SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) as highest_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;
User's Question: What if I want to see the employee names with the highest salary in each department?

[OUTPUT]
{
    "results": [
        {
            "sql": "SELECT department_id, employee_name, salary FROM employees WHERE (department_id, salary) IN (SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id)",
            "summary": "Shows the names of employees who earn the highest salary in their respective departments."
        },
        {
            "sql": "SELECT e.department_id, e.employee_name, e.salary FROM employees e INNER JOIN (SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) as max_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) d ON e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.salary = d.max_salary",
            "summary": "Lists employees with the highest salary in each department."
        },
        {
            "sql": "WITH MaxSalaries AS (SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) as max_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) SELECT e.department_id, e.employee_name, e.salary FROM employees e JOIN MaxSalaries m ON e.department_id = m.department_id AND e.salary = m.max_salary",
            "summary": "Utilizes a CTE to display each department's highest earners along with their names and salaries."
        }
    ]
}

### FINAL ANSWER FORMAT ###
The final answer must be the JSON format like following:

{
    "results": [
        {"sql": <SQL_QUERY_STRING_1>, "summary": <SUMMARY_STRING_1>},
        {"sql": <SQL_QUERY_STRING2>, "summary": <SUMMARY_STRING_2>},
        {"sql": <SQL_QUERY_STRING3>, "summary": <SUMMARY_STRING_3>}
    ]
}

{{ alert }}

### QUESTION ###
Previous SQL Summary: {{ history.summary }}
Previous SQL Query: {{ history.sql }}
User's Follow-up Question: {{ query }}

Let's think step by step.
