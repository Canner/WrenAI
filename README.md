### 5. Generate SQL Queries with Context

> With Wren AI, you can process metadata, schema, terminology, data relationships, and the logic behind calculations and aggregations with [‚ÄúModeling Definition Language‚Äù](https://docs.getwren.ai/oss/engine/concept/what_is_mdl/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=readme), reducing duplicate coding and simplifying data joins.

</p>

### 6. Get Insights without Writing Code

> When starting a new conversation in Wren AI, your question is used to find the most relevant tables. From these, LLM generates the most relevant question for the user. You can also ask follow-up questions to get deeper insights.

## ü§ñ Wren AI Text-to-SQL Agentic Architecture

Wren AI consists of three core services:

- ***[Wren UI](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ui):*** An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources.

- ***[Wren AI Service](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ai-service):*** Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.

- ***[Wren Engine](https://github.com/Canner/wren-engine):*** Serves as the semantic engine, mapping business terms to data sources, defining relationships, and incorporating predefined calculations and aggregations.
