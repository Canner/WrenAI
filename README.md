> WrenAI is a **text-to-SQL solution** for data teams to get results and insights faster by asking business questions without writing SQL.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Video Introduction

## üéØ Our Mission

WrenAI‚Äôs mission is to democratize data by bringing text-to-SQL ability to any data source and industry. We believe that breakthroughs in Text-to-SQL technology will usher in a new era of Data Democratization.

## üëä Text-to-SQL End-To-End Solution

### 1. Indexing With Semantics

> WrenAI has implemented a [semantic engine architecture](https://blog.getwren.ai/how-we-design-our-semantic-engine-for-llms-84a00e6e3baa) to provide the LLM context of your business; you can easily establish a logical presentation layer on your data schema that helps LLM learn more about your business context.

### 2. Augment LLM Prompts

> With WrenAI, you can process metadata, schema, terminology, data relationships, and the logic behind calculations and aggregations with [‚ÄúModeling Definition Language‚Äù (MDL)](https://docs.getwren.ai/engine/concept/what_is_mdl), reducing duplicate coding and simplifying data joins.

### 3. Generate Insights

> When starting a new conversation in WrenAI, your question is used to find the most relevant tables. From these, LLM generates three relevant questions for the user to choose from. You can also ask follow-up questions to get deeper insights.

### 4. Self-Learning Feedback Loop (Coming Soon)

> The AI self-learning feedback loop is designed to refine SQL augmentation and generation by collecting data from various sources. These include user query history, revision intentions, feedback, schema patterns, semantics enhancement, and query frequency.

## ü§î Why WrenAI?

We focus on providing an open, secure, and reliable text-to-SQL solution for everyone.

### 1. Turnkey Solution

> WrenAI makes it easy to onboard your data. Discover and analyze your data with our user interface. Effortlessly generate results without needing to code.

### 2. Secure By Design

> Your database contents will never be transmitted to the LLM. Only metadata, like schemas, documentation, and queries, will be used in semantic search.

### 3. Open-Source

> Deploy WrenAI anywhere you like on your own data, LLM APIs, and environment, it's free.

## ü§ñ WrenAI's Architecture

WrenAI consists of three core services:

- ***[Wren UI](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ui):*** An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources within WrenAI's framework.

- ***[Wren AI Service](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ai-service):*** Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.

- ***[Wren Engine](https://github.com/Canner/wren-engine):*** Serves as the semantic engine, mapping business terms to data sources, defining relationships, and incorporating predefined calculations and aggregations.
