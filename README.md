## üéØ Our Vision & Mission

At Wren AI, our mission is to revolutionize business intelligence by empowering organizations with seamless access to data through Generative Business Intelligence (GenBI). We aim to break down barriers to data insights with advanced AI-driven solutions, composable data frameworks, and semantic intelligence, enabling every team member to make faster, smarter, and data-driven decisions with confidence.
