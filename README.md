> WrenAI is ***your AI data assistant*** that helps you get results and insights faster by asking questions without writing SQL.

![wrenai_overview](./misc/wrenai_overview.png)

## 🎯 Our Mission

WrenAI is dedicated to reimagining how businesses can interact with and leverage their data through LLM, by bringing comprehension capabilities to small and large data teams.

## 🤔 Benefits using WrenAI

WrenAI leverages Large Language Models (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to enhance comprehension of internal data.  Below are the three key benefits:

### 1. Fast Onboarding

> Discover and analyze your data with our user interface. Effortlessly generate results without needing to code.

### 2. Secure By Design

> Your database contents will never be transmitted to the LLM. Only metadata, like schemas, documentation, and queries, will be used in semantic search.

### 3. Open-Source

> Deploy WrenAI anywhere you like on your own data, LLM APIs, and environment, it's free.

## 🤖 WrenAI's Architecture

WrenAI is consist of three core services:

- ***Wren UI:*** An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources within WrenAI's framework.

- ***Wren AI Service:*** Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.

- ***Wren Engine:*** Serves as the platform's backbone, managing metadata and connecting to data sources, while preparing for future application integrations.

## 🤞 Design Philosophies

We have some core design philosophies that were used when developing WrenAI.

- **Explainability**: WrenAI ensures that every SQL query generated in natural language is accurate, concise, and reliable.
- **Interoperability**: WrenAI enables users to query data from multiple sources without dealing with the complexities of different data formats and dialects, providing a standard interface across different sources.
- **Interactive Experience**: WrenAI is designed to engage users in a dialogue, clarifying their queries and refining results in real time.
- **Continuous Learning**: WrenAI will proactively learn through ongoing query history, feedback, and interactions. Incorporating new patterns, information, and data structures into our LLM knowledge base.

## 🚧 Project Status

WrenAI is currently in ***alpha version***. The project team is actively working on progress and aiming to release new versions at least biweekly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using WrenAI is super simple, you can setup within 3 minutes, and start to interact with your own data!
