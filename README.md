👉 [Try with your data!](https://getwren.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=readme)


## 🎯 Our Vision & Mission

Wren AI’s mission is to democratize data by bringing AI agents with SQL ability to any data source.

🤩 [About our Vision](https://www.getwren.ai/post/the-new-wave-of-composable-data-systems-and-the-interface-to-llm-agents)

🙌 [About our Mission](https://www.getwren.ai/post/4-key-technical-challenges-using-rag-with-llms-to-query-database-text-to-sql-and-how-to-solve-it)

## 🤖 SQL AI Agent on your data

### 1. Indexing With Semantics

> Wren AI has implemented a [semantic engine architecture](https://www.getwren.ai/post/how-we-design-our-semantic-engine-for-llms-the-backbone-of-the-semantic-layer-for-llm-architecture) to provide the LLM context of your business; you can easily establish a logical presentation layer on your data schema that helps LLM learn more about your business context.

### 2. Generate SQL Queries With Context

> With Wren AI, you can process metadata, schema, terminology, data relationships, and the logic behind calculations and aggregations with [“Modeling Definition Language”](https://docs.getwren.ai/oss/engine/concept/what_is_mdl), reducing duplicate coding and simplifying data joins.

### 3. Get Insights Without Writing Code

> When starting a new conversation in Wren AI, your question is used to find the most relevant tables. From these, LLM generates three relevant questions for the user to choose from. You can also ask follow-up questions to get deeper insights.

### 4. Self-Learning Feedback Loop (Coming Soon)

  > The AI self-learning feedback loop refines SQL augmentation and generation by collecting data from various sources. These include user query history, revision intentions, feedback, schema patterns, semantics enhancement, and query frequency.

## 🤔 Why Wren AI?

We focus on providing an open, secure, and reliable SQL AI Agent for everyone.

### 1. Turnkey Solution

> Wren AI makes it easy to onboard your data. Discover and analyze your data with our user interface. Effortlessly generate results without needing to code.

### 2. Secure By Design

> Your database content will never be transmitted to the LLM. Only metadata, like schemas, documentation, and queries, will be used in semantic search.

### 3. Open-Source

> Deploy Wren AI anywhere you like on your own data, LLM APIs, and environment, it's free.

## 🤖 Wren AI Agentic Architecture

Wren AI consists of three core services:

- ***[Wren UI](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ui):*** An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources within Wren AI's framework.

- ***[Wren AI Service](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ai-service):*** Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.

- ***[Wren Engine](https://github.com/Canner/wren-engine):*** Serves as the semantic engine, mapping business terms to data sources, defining relationships, and incorporating predefined calculations and aggregations.
