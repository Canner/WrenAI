> WrenAI is a **text-to-SQL solution** for data teams to get results and insights faster by asking business questions without writing SQL.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Video Introduction

## üéØ Our Mission

WrenAI is reimagining how businesses can interact with and leverage their data through LLM by bringing comprehension capabilities to database data structures.

üëâ [Learn more about our mission](https://docs.getwren.ai/overview/introduction)

## üëä Why WrenAI?

### 1. Reduce Hallucination

> WrenAI offers detailed, explainable responses, ensuring users understand the origins and context of their data, thereby reducing ***hallucinations*** in LLMs.

### 2. Augment Your LLM Knowledge Base

> WrenAI enriches LLMs with your specific business context, with additional metadata for your data schema, such as semantics and relationships.

### 3. Self-Learning Feedback Loop

> WrenAI evolves with every interaction. It learns from user feedback and behavioral patterns, continuously refining its suggestions.

## üî• Preview

### Ask your business questions and follow-up insights

## ü§î Benefits using WrenAI

WrenAI leverages Large Language Models (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to enhance comprehension of internal data.  Below are the three key benefits:

### 1. Fast Onboarding

> Discover and analyze your data with our user interface. Suitable for data analysts, and non-technical users to use.

### 2. Secure By Design

> Your database contents will never be transmitted to the LLM. Only metadata, like schemas, documentation, and queries, will be used in semantic search.

### 3. Open-Source

> Deploy WrenAI anywhere you like on your own data, LLM APIs, and environment, it's free.

## ü§ñ WrenAI's Architecture

WrenAI is consist of three core services:

- ***[Wren UI](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ui):*** An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources within WrenAI's framework.

- ***[Wren AI Service](https://github.com/Canner/WrenAI/tree/main/wren-ai-service):*** Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.

- ***[Wren Engine](https://github.com/Canner/wren-engine):*** Serves as the semantic engine, mapping business terms to data sources, defining relationships, and incorporating predefined calculations and aggregations.

## ü§û Design Philosophies

We have some core design philosophies that were used when developing WrenAI.

- **Explainability**: WrenAI ensures that every SQL query generated in natural language is accurate, concise, and reliable.
- **Interoperability**: WrenAI enables users to query data from multiple sources without dealing with the complexities of different data formats and dialects, providing a standard interface across different sources.
- **Interactive Experience**: WrenAI is designed to engage users in a dialogue, clarifying their queries and refining results in real time.
- **Continuous Learning**: WrenAI will proactively learn through ongoing query history, feedback, and interactions. Incorporating new patterns, information, and data structures into our LLM knowledge base.

## üöß Project Status

WrenAI is currently in ***alpha version***. The project team is actively working on progress and aiming to release new versions at least biweekly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Using WrenAI is super simple, you can setup within 3 minutes, and start to interact with your own data!
